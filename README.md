#
1) This is a MATLAB based FMCW RF Radar Simulator. 
2) It generates 1T4R 24G Multi-lane Multi-vechile FMCW Traffic Radar raw data. 
3) Your can try develop your radar data processing algorithm base on this simulator.
4) As a charllenge, can you develope your algorithm to detect the [X position,Y position, Lane number, Velocity] of each vechile.
5) Run main.m in matlab to start trying out.

An experimental algorithm of detecting [X position,Y position, Lane number, Velocity] may be uploaded if more than 25 starts â˜… are issued.
